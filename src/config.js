      {name: 'BruinScope', description: 'One stop shop for all things technical interview related, catered specially to Bruins with the goal of improving the quality of engineers UCLA produces and broadening the job scope for all those out there aiming to land their dream company. BruinScope aims to become the home of interview experiences, questions and general forum discussions for the latest and greatest in the technical interviewing world, whether that be for Software, Product Management or Design.'},
      {name: 'OrgManager', description: 'Born directly from the former Devops team of ACM, the goal of this project is to answer the long time need for a membership and general club management system in ACM. The project aims to make it easy for club administration to view member\'s attendance, update events, and add a competitive element to attending those events with a points and level system, and a leaderboard.\nThe goal is to have the system be adopted by other organizations around campus. As such, its interface is designed to be customizable, and its services configurable. Deployment is extremely simple as it is a portable, containerized service that can run anywhere Docker can.'},
      {name: 'Klaaci', description: 'This project is a web application that will be used by UCLA students to obtain class recommendations for their upcoming quarter, based off of classing they have taken in the past and how they liked them, as well as Bruinwalk data. The idea is that each student will be able to get personalized recommendations that fit his or her schedule, as well as the classes that they still have to take. Our goal is to eliminate the time it takes for students to come through several bruinwalk reviews, see if the class fits their degree requirements, and then see if the class fits their day schedule/exam schedule. Moreover we leverage a large amount of data and machine learning algorithms to recommend teachers based on other students’ reviews and your past teachers, so it’s like having the opinion of hundreds of your friends at your fingertips.'},
      {name: 'Bruin Meet', description: 'UCLA is a huge school, and students often have trouble finding partners or groups to study, dine, or go to social events with. With Bruin Meet, we want this experience to be easier and more approachable for all students. BM will provide a safe community for students to openly invite each other with all relevant information in one place. This project is built with React and Django with a goal to create a clean and secure interface for all users.'},
      {name: 'Bruin Academy', description: 'The disparity between women and underrepresented minorities who pass introductory computer science courses and men who pass is one of the largest differences across UCLA. Bruin Academy is an online platform to provide support and resources to students who are struggling. The introductory courses introduce difficult topics in less than ten weeks, and the difficulty is exacerbated when students have no prior experience coding. The platform connects students with notes, tutorials and mastery-based learning, to better prepare them for success in these courses. The purpose is to eliminate any social, cultural, internal factors that may be preventing students from learning and understanding the material.'},
      {name: 'BruinSpeak', description: 'At UCLA, there is often a disconnect between decision-makers, and those who are affected by their decisions. BruinSpeak allows for any student at UCLA to create proposals for changes that they would like to see on campus, as well as to voice their opinions about existing proposals. The desire is for student government organizations UCLA management to use this as a resource to see the changes that students are passionate about.'},
      {name: 'Bruin Connections', description: 'Our goal is to make it easier for UCLA students to connect. (more will be added tomorrow)'},
      {name: 'Loop', description: 'Loop is an innovative way to trade, buy, and sell. Users pick what textbooks they want and what they\'re willing to trade for them (or prices to buy/sell at), and our algorithm will do the rest.\nBy comparing book lists of all of our users, Loop automatically generates the smartest trade circles that maximize the number of people who get what they want, with almost no effort involved on the part of the user. People who get matched up with a sale or trade can then meet up in person to complete the exchange.'},
